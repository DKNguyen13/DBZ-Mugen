## ⚙️ FSM Integration

The game leverages a **Finite State Machine (FSM)** to manage character AI behavior, ensuring smooth and responsive opponent actions. Each character’s AI is structured into states such as:

- **Idle**: Waiting for player input or action triggers.  
- **Attack**: Executing combos, special moves, or defensive maneuvers.  
- **Defend**: Blocking or dodging incoming attacks.  
- **Movement**: Navigating the arena with strategic positioning.

The FSM system allows for seamless transitions between states based on game conditions, creating dynamic and engaging battles.
